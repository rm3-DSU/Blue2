This project is to create a C2 system to explore malware concepts. It builds of some previous work but is now somewhat functional. The client / server code is now functional but buggy so there is a lot of work still to do. 

Files included:

BarNapkin.txt: Quick overview of basic design requirements

client.py: Basic Client to connect and interact with server

server.py: Multithreaded server, includes some basic functionality to help communicate with clients

Slides_Matthews_BlueTeam_Cycle6.pdf: Slides of the presentation describing the project
